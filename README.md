# Cat & Dog Image Classifier 
This project presents a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based image classification model designed to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. Developed within a Google Colab environment, the solution encompasses a complete machine learning pipeline.

Key aspects of the project include:

Data Management: Utilizes Google Drive integration for dataset loading, followed by automated extraction and restructuring of image data into a format suitable for deep learning frameworks.

Model Architecture: Implements a custom CNN architecture, incorporating layers for convolution, pooling, flattening, dropout, and dense connections, optimized for binary image classification.

Training and Evaluation: Employs ImageDataGenerator for efficient data augmentation and batch processing during model training. Performance is rigorously evaluated on a dedicated validation set, with metrics such as loss, accuracy, and a detailed classification report provided.

Interactive Prediction: Features a command-line interface for real-time inference on individual image files, demonstrating practical application of the trained model.

Technological Stack: Primarily built with Python, leveraging TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning, NumPy for numerical operations, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization.

The model achieves approximately 83% validation accuracy, demonstrating effective classification capabilities. This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of deep learning principles applied to a common computer vision task, highlighting skills in data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and interactive deployment.
